      <h2>Ecological Importance</h2>
      <p>Willow trees play a vital role in maintaining river ecosystems. Their deep roots help filter water and prevent flooding. They provide shelter for birds, insects, and small animals, and act as nurseries for aquatic life. The leaves, when they fall, enrich the soil with organic matter, supporting overall biodiversity.</p>
